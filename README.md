touch-sprite-demo
=================

An HTML rapid touch-based animation proof-of-concept

This demo simply iterates through each frame of a CSS sprite as you alternately tap two buttons on the page. It is the digital equivalent of a [flip book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book).

[fastclick.js](http://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/) was used to remove the 300ms delay in firing touch events in some browsers.

Best experienced on a modern smartphone or tablet device.
